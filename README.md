# Machine Learning & Bayesian Statistics: Project Overview
- abc
- def

## Code and Resources Used
__R Version__: 3.6.2 \
__Packages__: dplyr, ggplot2, ggthemes, multcomp, caret, randomForest, class, e1071, R2jags, ggmcmc

## Part One: Machine Learning
The following steps have been conducted:
- Visualized the data via bivariate scatterplots with colour-coding
- Split the data in training and test set
- Applied the k-nearest-neighbours (KNN) method in order to construct a classifier to predict the location
- Applied the Random Forest (bagging) method in order to construct a classifier to predict the location
- Applied the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm in order to construct a classifier to predict the location
- Visualized the resulting classification rule for each method
- Tested the methods on the test set, finding the test error for each model
